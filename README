API for LSD library

To install it to your Python interpreter, type:
	python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install


Usage example:
	from lsd import lsd
	image = lsd(image_path = "data/1.pgm")
Or with parameters:
	image = lsd(scale = 0.8, sigma_coef = 0.6, quant = 2.0,
				ang_th = 22.5, log_eps = 0, density_th = 0.7,
				n_bins = 1024, image_path = "data/1.pgm")

image will be an object with attribute region -- list with dicts, each dict describe one region:
	{'x1': x1, 'y1': y1, 'x2': x2, 'y2': y2, 'width': width,
		'p': p, 'NFA': NFA}
	
Where NFA is actually -log10(NFA)
and p is an angle precision in radians (by default it is
equal to ang_th / 180, but if potentially good region have very
small NFA value, algorithm will try finer precisions)

NFA method:
	answ = image.NFA(x1, y1, x2, y2, width)
answ is equal to -log10(NFA)

Getting point gradient:
    answ = image.grad(x, y)
answ[0] is the module of the gradient vector
answ[1] is the angle
