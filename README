API for LSD library

To install it to your Python interpreter, type:
	python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install


Usage example:
	from lsd import lsd
	image = lsd(image_path = "data/1.pgm")
Or with parameters:
	image = lsd(scale = 0.8, sigma_coef = 0.6, quant = 2.0,
				ang_th = 22.5, log_eps = 0, density_th = 0.7,
				n_bins = 1024, image_path = "data/1.pgm")

image will be an object with attribute region -- list with dicts, each dict describe one region:
	{'x1': x1, 'y1': y1, 'x2': x2, 'y2': y2, 'width': width,
		'p': p, 'NFA': NFA}
	
Where NFA is actually -log10(NFA)
and p is an angle precision in radians (by default it is
equal to ang_th / 180, but if potentially good region have very
small NFA value, algorithm will try finer precisions)

NFA method:
	answ = image.NFA(x1, y1, x2, y2, width)
answ is equal to -log10(NFA)

Getting point gradient:
    answ = image.grad(x, y)
answ[0] is the module of the gradient vector
answ[1] is the angle. If gradient vector has too small module to be sure about angle, angle will be None.

usage_example.py has awful code, but you still can see it and try LSD algorithm in work.
Firstly example script will ask to choose PGM image file and open it. When left click will put gradient vector for clicked point in to terminal.
Right click to add point: first two point are opposite sides of the rectangle and third is point on the long side. It is better to show, then to tell, so ty it.
Middle mouse button click will erase rectangles from the image.

Enjoy!
